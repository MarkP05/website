        <p>My name is Mark Pfister, and I am a Computer Science major with a 3+1 in Cybersecurity at Quinnipiac University. 
            I am studying Computer Science because it has been a dream of mine to learn code since I was young, 
            and I eventually want to be able to develop my own video games at some point too. I currently know basic
            fundamentals of Networks, advanced levels of Java, some C#, and I have a deep understanding of Computer Science
            as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of education, my biggest hobby is just playing video games on my free time. During the winter, 
            I like to travel North to go snowboarding with my family. I have been doing this since I was a toddler, 
            so I am pretty good at it. I spend most of my time currently either doing school related work, or playing video games.
