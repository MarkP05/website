        <p>Hello, welcome to my website! I made this so anyone can look through it and learn a little bit more
            about me on a personal level. The following links can direct you to different pages. The About me link
            will take you to a page so you can learn more about me. The Projects link will take you to a page 
            where you can see the major projects I have completed so far. 
        </p>
