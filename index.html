        <p>Hello, welcome to my website! I created this space to give visitors an opportunity to explore who I am and what I do in a more personal and meaningful way. Whether you're a friend, a colleague, or just a curious passerby, I hope you find something interesting or inspiring here. Take your time browsing and feel free to reach out if anything catches your eye or sparks a question.</p>
        
        <p>The <strong>About me</strong> link will take you to a dedicated page where you can discover more about my background, interests, and the journey that has shaped who I am today. From my hobbies and values to my personal and professional experiences, this section is a deep dive into the things that make me, well—me.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Projects</strong> link leads to a showcase of the major projects I’ve worked on so far. This includes a range of creative and technical work that reflects my skills, passions, and problem-solving abilities. Each project is accompanied by a description and, where possible, images or links so you can dive deeper into what I’ve built or contributed to.</p>
